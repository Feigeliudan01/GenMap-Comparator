1@Raw Data
2@This table shows the raw marker data (as read from your input file) for the selected map. You can sort rows (i.e. markers) according to i) chromosome/group location, ii) name or iii) position.
3@Select the reference map:
4@Select chromosome(s):
5@You can also search for a specific marker based on its name.
6@Marker Information and Filtering
7@It is also possible to remove markers from the analysis. If you want to do so, please type the name of a marker to remove (e.g: ’sPb-601’) or a pattern to remove using regular expressions (e.g. typing ’sPb.*’ will remove all markers starting by sPb). If you want to remove several markers/patterns, separate them with a comma (e.g: ’sPb-601,xbarc-213’). You can also decide to keep only some markers, selecting the ‘keep’ option.
