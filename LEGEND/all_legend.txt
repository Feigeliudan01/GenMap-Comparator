1@Welcome to a world of genetic map. If you need to compare and characterize maps
2@you are in the right place!
3@Please select your data: 
4@With contribution of
5@Choose chromosome!
6@Compare positions
7@Choose chromosome!
8@choose_maps
9@Interchromosomal Analysis
10@Choose chromosome!
11@Fig. 5: Comparison of markers positions for 2 selected maps. Choosing 1 chromosome only, it permits to visualize evolution of recombination rates among maps. If you select all chromosomes, it permits to discover interchromosomal recombinations
12@Rough Map
13@Choose chromosome!
14@Fig. 6: This table shows the rough data: the selected map as you gave it in input. You can order it by chromosome or position, search for a specific marker...
15@The Genmap Comparator is an application developped to compare and characterize genetic maps. 
16@It is sooo easy to use it.
17@1 -- Somewhere in your computer, create a directory and add all the maps you want to compare.
18@2 -- Your maps must be in the basic format, commonly used in all map softwares. Basically, it should look like that:
19@     File Demo
20@3 -- Go to the home page of this app, add select your folder. Now you just have to naviguate from one page to another !
21@If you use this app in your studies, please cite this reference, it helps to spread the tool !
