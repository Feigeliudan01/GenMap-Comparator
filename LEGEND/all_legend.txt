1@A user friendly tool to compare and characterize genetic maps.
2@you are in the right place!
3@Please select your data files: 
4@With contribution of
5@Choose chromosome!
6@Compare positions
7@Choose chromosome!
8@rien, jâ€™ai fait nimp
9@Interchromosomal Analysis
10@Choose chromosome!
11@Fig. 5: Comparison of markers positions for 2 selected maps. Selecting a single chromosome allows to visualize the evolution of recombination rates between maps. Selecting all chromosomes allows to visualize interchromosomal recombinations
12@Raw data
13@Choose chromosome!
14@Fig. 6: This table shows the rough data: the selected map as you gave it in input. You can order it by chromosome or position, search for a specific marker...
15@The Genmap Comparator is an application developped to compare and characterize genetic maps. 
16@It is sooo easy to use it.
17@1 -- Somewhere in your computer, create a directory and add all the maps you want to compare.
18@2 -- Your maps must be in the basic format, commonly used in all map softwares. Basically, it should look like that:
