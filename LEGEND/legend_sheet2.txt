1@Summary Statistics
2@ - Key Statistics (several maps) - 
3@Here you can compare various maps through five key statistics:
4@ 1. Number of genetic markers, 2. Overall size (in cM), 3. Average gap size between 2 of their markers (cM), 4. Size of their biggest gap (cM) and the number of unique positions. 
5@ - Key Statistics (1 map) - 
6@This table provides five key statistics for the chromosomes of the selected map: 1. their number of genetic markers, 2. their overall size (in cM), 3. the average gap size between 2 of their markers (cM), 4. the size of their biggest gap (cM) and the number of unique positions. This is the usual table you provide when doing a publication involving genetic maps.
7@ - Marker Density - 
8@Here is a description of marker density along chromosomes. This figure allows to visualize chromosome length variation among maps, and to identify regions with unusually high/low genetic marker density.
