3@The Genetic map comparators allows to compare easily and quickly several genetic maps. Please start by uploading your maps through the « Home » sheet. Two example datasets (from sorghum and wheat) are also provided in case you just want to discover the application possibilities.
4@Several sheets are provided, each aiming to study a specific feature of your maps. It should allow you to get simple usual statistics and compare them, and visualize the marker positions in an efficient way.
5@ - Input Files - 
6@The application imports linkage data from map files, produced by software for linkage analysis. The columns names of files does not matter. Columns must be separated by either ";" or tabulation (« \t »). Two formats are accepted:
7@-Carthagene format: where map files are composed of 3 columns: linkage group, marker name and position in the map.
8@-MapChart format: where map files are composed of a sequence of linkage groups, each with a header line specifying the linkage group title, followed by a sequence of lines with locus names and map positions. Such map files are exported by JoinMap 3.0
