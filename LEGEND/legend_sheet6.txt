3@The Genetic map comparator allows to easily compare several genetic maps. The first step is to upload your maps through the « Home » sheet. Two example datasets (from sorghum and wheat) are provided to easily explore the Genetic map comparator features.
4@Once a dataset is upload you can explore it using the various sheets accessible via links at the top of the window. Each sheet help you to study some specific features of your maps, they allow you to compare your maps via standart statistics (number of markers, average gap size betweeen marker etc.) as well as to get visual representation of your map congruences through plot of marker positions along chromosomes.

6@The Genetic map comparator is able to import map files produced by most widespread software for linkage analysis (e.g. Carthagene and JoinMap). Each map being in its own file (and all in the same folder), use the upload facility of the home page to browse your local folders and select desired maps using multiple file selection. The column names does not matter but they must be ordered correctly (see details and example below) and be separated by either ";" or tabulation (« \t »). Three formats are accepted:
